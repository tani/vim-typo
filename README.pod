Vim-typo is an auto-correction plugin for Vim/Neovim that relies
on a syntax file to provide intelligent corrections while typing.

=head2 Installation X<typo-installation>

To install vim-typo, follow the standard procedure for installing Vim plugins.
Here is an example using L<vim-jetpack|https://github.com/tani/vim-jetpack>:

 Jetpack 'tani/vim-typo'

=head2 Configuration X<typo-configuration>

C<b:typo_did_setup> is a buffer local variable that is set to 1,
when the autocorrection is enabled. if you want to prevent the autocorrection
from being enabled for a specific file type, you can set this variable to 1.
                                                       X<typo-b:typo_did_setup>

 autocmd FileType typescript let b:typo_did_setup = 1

To work with the tree-sitter, you need to enable the regex syntax highlighting,
which is disabled by default. You can enable it by adding the following line
                                                       X<typo-tree-sitter>

 vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {
   group = 'Vimrc',
   pattern = '*',
   callback = function(args)
     vim.bo[args.buf].syntax = 'on'
   end,
 })

=head2 Algorithm Overview X<typo-algorithm>

The auto-correction algorithm used in vim-typo involves two main operations:
completion and swapping. Typos in words, excluding the first and last letters,
are corrected. The algorithm focuses specifically on correcting typos in words
that are at least 6 characters long.

During typing, vim-typo dynamically retrieves the word source
from the syntax file, enabling on-the-fly autocorrections.
