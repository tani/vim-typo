=============================================================================
vim-typo~

Vim-typo is an auto-correction plugin for Vim/Neovim that relies
on a syntax file to provide intelligent corrections while typing.

Installation ~
                                                          *typo-installation*

To install vim-typo, follow the standard procedure for installing Vim plugins.
Here is an example using [vim-jetpack](https://github.com/tani/vim-jetpack):

>
 Jetpack 'tani/vim-typo'

<

Configuration ~
                                                         *typo-configuration*

`b:typo_did_setup` is a buffer local variable that is set to 1,
when the autocorrection is enabled. if you want to prevent the autocorrection
from being enabled for a specific file type, you can set this variable to 1.
                                                       *typo-b:typo_did_setup*

>
 autocmd FileTypoe typescript let b:typo_did_setup = 1

Algorithm Overview ~
                                                             *typo-algorithm*

The auto-correction algorithm used in vim-typo involves two main operations:
completion and swapping. Typos in words, excluding the first and last letters,
are corrected. The algorithm focuses specifically on correcting typos in words
that are at least 6 characters long.

During typing, vim-typo dynamically retrieves the word source
from the syntax file, enabling on-the-fly autocorrections.
